This has been done using Spring MVC and Hibernate which has a MySQL Server runnning at the backend.

Upcoming Changes
================

1.) Adding Issue type field ==> a.) Dev b.) Test c.) DevOps <br>
2.) Adding the ability to filter and search for issues using the Issue Type and owner (I plan to accomplish this using search indexing with Solr) <br>
3.) Creating Role Based Access Control (RBAC) <br>
